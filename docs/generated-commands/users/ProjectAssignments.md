# User Project Assignments

Admin permissions required, except when retrieving the currently authenticated userâ€™s project assignments.

## List active project assignments

Returns a list of active project assignments for the user identified by `USER_ID`. The project assignments are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recently created project assignments appearing first.

The response contains an object with a `project_assignments` property that contains an array of up to `per_page` project assignments. Each entry in the array is a separate project assignment object. If no more project assignments are available, the resulting array will be empty. Several additional pagination properties are included in the response to simplify paginating your project assignments.
