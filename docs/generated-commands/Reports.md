## Uninvoiced Report

The Uninvoiced Report highlights the uninvoiced hours and expenses for all billable projects in a given timeframe.

The response contains an object with a `results` property that contains an array of up to `per_page` results. Each entry in the array is a separate result object. If no more results are available, the resulting array will be empty. Several additional pagination properties are included in the response to simplify paginating your results.

Note: Each request requires both the `from` and `to` parameters to be supplied in the URLâ€™s query string. The timeframe supplied cannot exceed 1 year (365 days).
