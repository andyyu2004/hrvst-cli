## List all clients

Returns a list of your clients. The clients are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recently created clients appearing first.

The response contains an object with a `clients` property that contains an array of up to `per_page` clients. Each entry in the array is a separate client object. If no more clients are available, the resulting array will be empty. Several additional pagination properties are included in the response to simplify paginating your clients.
