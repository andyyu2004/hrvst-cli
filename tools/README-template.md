# Harvest CLI

[![Tests](https://github.com/kgajera/hrvst-cli/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kgajera/hrvst-cli/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)

This is an unofficial Harvest CLI that contains all features available in Harvest's [REST API V2](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/). The majority of the CLI is generated from an export of Harvest's [Postman Collection](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/introduction/overview/postman-collection/).

In addition to supporting features of the REST API, the Harvest CLI provides convenient ways to track time.

## Getting Started

### Install

Install the CLI using the `npm` package manager:

```
npm install -g hrvst-cli
```

### Log in with your Harvest account

To authenticate with Harvest's REST API, [client side OAuth2](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/authentication-api/authentication/authentication/#for-client-side-applications) is used. To initiate this, run:

```
hrvst login
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to launch your browser and log in to Harvest to grant Harvest CLI access to your account.
